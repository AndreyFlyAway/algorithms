/*
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to 
numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where 
prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first 
if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to 
first take course 1. 

Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0
you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
